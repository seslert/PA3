/**
 * This class is used to represent the state of the game after applying one of the available actions. It will also
 * track the A* specific information such as the parent pointer and the cost and heuristic function. Remember that
 * unlike the path planning A* from the first assignment the cost of an action may be more than 1. Specifically the cost
 * of executing a compound action such as move can be more than 1. You will need to account for this in your heuristic
 * and your cost function.
 *
 * The first instance is constructed from the StateView object (like in PA2). Implement the methods provided and
 * add any other methods and member variables you need.
 *
 * Some useful API calls for the state view are
 *
 * state.getXExtent() and state.getYExtent() to get the map size
 *
 * I recommend storing the actions that generated the instance of the GameState in this class using whatever
 * class/structure you use to represent actions.
